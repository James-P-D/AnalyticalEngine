## Introduction

In the early 1800s, the English mathmatician Charles Babbage designed (but sadly never built) a mechanical general-purpose computer. Unlike previous inventions which were designed to perform a single task, the Analytical Engine was designed such that it could perform *many* tasks, and is therefore often considered to be the 'first' computer.

There are many excellent sites, such as [jfinkels' GitHub](https://jfinkels.github.io/analyticalengine/) and [John Walker's site](https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/) which give great introductions to the workings of the proposed device.
